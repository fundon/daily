I love the coding. Read and write code is a very happy thing.
The code is not just only a text. It is a magic, a song. It is very powerful.
The world will be changed by it.


I type them every day, and push them to GitHub.
GitHub is a open source, is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers,
classmates and complete strangers. Over five million people use GitHub to build amazing
things together.
