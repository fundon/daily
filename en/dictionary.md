I bought a dictionary about five months ago.
But it was used few times. I am very lazy.
It is not a good habit. I must change.

If I look at a new word, do not understand the meaning of new word.
Force to open the dictionary, find it, understand it why, how, what.

Learning every day, i think it is very important!
