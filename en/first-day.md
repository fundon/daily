I want to improve my English skill, include speaking and writing, 
because my English is very bad.

How do I learn?

So, I created a couple rules for myself.

* Must write a post every day.
* Must speak an article every day.

I think lean English and play games are the same.
Play it and improve the level of games.

Ok, just do it! :)
